1. [Sooty](https://github.com/TheresAFewConors/Sooty) - Sooty is a tool developed with the task of aiding SOC analysts with automating part of their workflow. One of the goals of Sooty is to perform as many of the routine checks as possible, allowing the analyst more time to spend on deeper analysis within the same time-frame. Details for many of Sooty's features can be found below. 

2. [Peepdf](https://eternal-todo.com/tools/peepdf-pdf-analysis-tool) - peepdf is a Python tool to explore PDF files in order to find out if the file can be harmful or not. The aim of this tool is to provide all the necessary components that a security researcher could need in a PDF analysis without using 3 or 4 tools to make all the tasks. With peepdf it's possible to see all the objects in the document showing the suspicious elements, supports the most used filters and encodings, it can parse different versions of a file, object streams and encrypted files. With the installation of PyV8 and Pylibemu it provides Javascript and shellcode analysis wrappers too. Apart of this it is able to create new PDF files, modify existent ones and obfuscate them.

3. [PyREBox](https://talosintelligence.com/pyrebox) - PyREBox is a Python scriptable Reverse Engineering sandbox. It is based on QEMU, and its goal is to aid reverse engineering by providing dynamic analysis and debugging capabilities from a different perspective. PyREBox allows to inspect a running QEMU VM, modify its memory or registers, and to instrument its execution, by creating simple scripts in Python to automate any kind of analysis. It also offers a shell based on IPython that exposes a rich set of commands, as well as a Python API.

4. [Fail2Ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) -  Fail2ban scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/error_log) and bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password failures, seeking for exploits, etc. Generally Fail2Ban is then used to update firewall rules to reject the IP addresses for a specified amount of time, although any arbitrary other action (e.g. sending an email) could also be configured. Out of the box Fail2Ban comes with filters for various services (apache, courier, ssh, etc).
• Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents. Configure services to use only two factor or public/private authentication mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

5. [OSSEC]( https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids)  [OSSEC](https://www.ossec.net/) is a full platform to monitor and control your systems. It mixes together all the aspects of HIDS (host-based intrusion detection), log monitoring and SIM/SIEM together in a simple, powerful and open source solution.

13. [caldera](https://caldera.mitre.org/)
What does CALDERA do?
• CALDERA helps cybersecurity professionals reduce the amount of time and resources needed for routine cybersecurity testing.
• CALDERA empowers cyber teams in three main ways:
Autonomous Adversary Emulation
• With CALDERA, your cyber team can build a specific threat (adversary) profile and launch it in a network to see where you may be susceptible. This helps with testing defenses and training blue teams on how to detect specific threats.
Autonomous Incident Response
• Enables your team to perform automated incident response on a given host, allowing them to find new ways to identify and respond to threats.
Manual Red-Team Engagements
• Helps your red team perform manual assessments with computer assistance by augmenting existing offensive toolsets. The framework can be extended with any custom tools you may have.

14. [Atomic Red Team](https://atomicredteam.io)

15. [metta](https://github.com/uber-common/metta) - Metta is an information security preparedness tool.
This project uses Redis/Celery, python, and vagrant with virtualbox to do adversarial simulation. This allows you to test (mostly) your host based instrumentation but may also allow you to test any network based detection and controls depending on how you set up your vagrants.
The project parses yaml files with actions and uses celery to queue these actions up and run them one at a time without interaction

16. [OSSIM](https://cybersecurity.att.com/products/ossim) - AlienVault® OSSIMTM, Open Source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), provides you with a feature-rich open source SIEM complete with event collection, normalization and correlation. Launched by security engineers because of the lack of available open source products, AlienVault OSSIM was created specifically to address the reality many security professionals face: A SIEM, whether it is open source or commercial, is virtually useless without the basic security controls necessary for security visibility.

17. [Prelude](https://www.prelude-siem.org/) - Prelude is a Universal "Security Information & Event Management" (SIEM) system. Prelude collects, normalizes, sorts, aggregates, correlates and reports all security-related events independently of the product brand or license giving rise to such events; Prelude is "agentless".
• As well as being capable of recovering any type of log (system logs, syslog, flat files, etc.), Prelude benefits from a native support with a number of systems dedicated to enriching information even further (snort, samhain, ossec, auditd, etc.).
